Captive axolotls are also more likely to encounter iodine, which is used to produce thyroxin, which causes morphing.",

NH3 is poisonous to aquatic animals, and given amphibian's permiable skin and flowy gills, they are especially at risk, so the levels of this chemical must be 0. Luckily there is a type of beneficial bacteria (BB) that you can grow in your filter or substrate to convert NH3 to Nitrites, NO2-. You may be thinking \"that's great, now there's no ammonia and my axolotl is safe!\" but NO2- is also somewhat toxic and its levels must be 0 in your tank as well. That calls for yet another culture of BB, bacteria that turns NO2- into Nitrates, NO3-, which is indeed much less harmful if kept below about 20 ppm. This NO3- is then removed with less urgency, mostly by water changes but in smaller amounts by live plants"
